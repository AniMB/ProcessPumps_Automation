# ProcessPumps_Automation
The Code for the process pumps automation project is to be circulated using this media. There are certain rules that must be followed. There shall be no committing changes to the main branch
All the changes must be first branched and a pull request should be made. 
Now, moving onto the project:
The project involves recieving data from multiple sensors connected to a pump testing asssmebly and processing it with the information that we recieve from the user.
The input to the system shall be made using arduino
Then we shall extarct the data, using tkinter from the user.
Finally, both the datasets shall be combined to give the most a final database and a graph.
